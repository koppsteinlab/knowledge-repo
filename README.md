# Knowledge base of the Group for Cancer Bioinformatics and Multiomics (CABAM)

Welcome to the internal knowledge base of the Koppstein Lab!

Here, we will gather all important configurations for using the UKD and DKFZ resources, as well as generally important information for keeping the lab running.

The content in this repository is organized as a GitHub Wiki. Each article should focus on a single topic and provide clear, well-structured information.

You can access the knowledge base by either click here [Koppstein Knowledge Base](https://github.com/koppsteinlab/knowledge-repo/wiki) or by clicking on the Wiki button in the upper menu bar.
